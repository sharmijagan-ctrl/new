## 🧠 What is Cosmic Cantina?

**Cosmic Cantina** is a Sith-themed, Star Wars–inspired campus canteen pre-order system developed as part of the **Prompt Wars Hackathon**. This smooth and highly functional web app allows students to browse menus from **all food outlets in the VIT Chennai campus**, pre-order meals, and track order status — all in real-time.

It includes **two portals**:
- 👨‍🎓 **Student Portal**: For browsing menus, adding items to cart, placing orders, and tracking status.
- 👩‍🍳 **Canteen Staff Portal**: For managing incoming orders, updating status (processing, ready, completed), and handling outlet-specific orders.

All data is stored and synced using **Supabase** and **PostgreSQL**, ensuring a robust and real-time experience across all users.
